	abstract     = {Biometrics authentication is an effective method for automatically recognizing a person’s identity. Recently, it has been found that the finger–knuckle-print (FKP), which refers to the inherent skin patterns of the outer surface around the phalangeal joint of one’s finger, has high capability to discriminate different individuals, making it an emerging biometric identifier. In this paper, based on the results of psychophysics and neurophysiology studies that both local and global information is crucial for the image perception, we present an effective FKP recognition scheme by extracting and assembling local and global features of FKP images. Specifically, the orientation information extracted by the Gabor filters is coded as the local feature. By increasing the scale of Gabor filters to infinite, actually we can get the Fourier transform of the image, and hence the Fourier transform coefficients of the image can be taken as the global features. Such kinds of local and global features are naturally linked via the framework of time–frequency analysis. The proposed scheme exploits both local and global information for the FKP verification, where global information is also utilized to refine the alignment of FKP images in matching. The final matching distance of two FKPs is a weighted average of local and global matching distances. The experimental results conducted on our FKP database demonstrate that the proposed local–global information combination scheme could significantly improve the recognition accuracy obtained by either local or global information and lead to promising performance of an FKP-based personal authentication system.}

It covers many different areas of a hyper-connected world, including online payments, communications, access right management, etc. This work sheds light on the evolution of authentication systems towards Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) starting from Single-Factor Authentication (SFA) and through Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Particularly, MFA is expected to be utilized for human-to-everything interactions by enabling fast, user-friendly, and reliable authentication when accessing a service. This paper surveys the already available and emerging sensors (factor providers) that allow for authenticating a user with the system directly or by involving the cloud. The corresponding challenges from the user as well as the service provider perspective are also reviewed. The MFA system based on reversed Lagrange polynomial within Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) scheme is further proposed to enable more flexible authentication. This solution covers the cases of authenticating the user even if some of the factors are mismatched or absent. Our framework allows for qualifying the missing factors by authenticating the user without disclosing sensitive biometric data to the verification entity. Finally, a vision of the future trends in MFA is discussed.}

	abstract     = {Dimensionality reduction is an important pre-processing step for many applications. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the well known methods for supervised dimensionality reduction. However, the classical LDA formulation requires the nonsingularity of scatter matrices involved. For undersampled problems, where the data dimension is much larger than the sample size, all scatter matrices are singular and classical LDA fails. Many extensions, including null space based LDA (NLDA), orthogonal LDA (OLDA), etc, have been proposed in the past to overcome this problem. In this paper, we present a computational and theoretical analysis of NLDA and OLDA. Our main result shows that under a mild condition which holds in many applications involving high-dimensional data, NLDA is equivalent to OLDA. We have performed extensive experiments on various types of data and results are consistent with our theoretical analysis. The presented analysis and experimental results provide further insight into several LDA based algorithms.},

A large number of studies show that multibiometric fusion can greatly improve the recognition rate, antiattack, and robustness of the biometric recognition system. A method combining global features and local features was designed for the recognition of finger knuckle print images. On the one hand, principal component analysis (PCA) was used as the global feature for rapid recognition. On the other hand, the local binary pattern (LBP) operator was taken as the local feature in order to extract the texture features that can reflect details. A two-layer serial fusion strategy is proposed in the combination of global and local features. Firstly, the sample library scope was narrowed according to the global matching result. Secondly, the matching result was further determined by fine matching. By combining the fast speed of global coarse matching and the high accuracy of local refined matching, the designed method can improve the recognition rate and the recognition speed.}

Among the many approaches, biometrics such as palmprints provide highly effective automatic mechanisms for use in personal identification. This paper presents a new method for extracting features from palmprints using the Competitive Coding Scheme and angular matching. The Competitive Coding Scheme uses multiple 2-D Gabor filters to extract orientation information from palm lines. This information is then stored in a feature vector called the Competitive Code. The angular matching with an effective implementation is then defined for comparing the proposed codes, which can make over 9,000 comparisons within 1s. In our testing database of 7,752 palmprint samples from 386 palms, we can achieve a high genuine acceptance rate of 98.4\% and a low false acceptance rate of 3 x 10^{-6}\%. The execution time for the whole process of verification, including preprocessing, feature extraction and final matching, is 1s.},
